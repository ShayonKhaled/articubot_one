†di∑# Humblebot

This repository documents my journey to learn and work with ROS 2 by building a teleoperated differential drive robot. The project runs ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu Mate 22.04, using a Raspberry Pi 4B to communicate with an onboard microcontroller ESP32) over serial. The system includes real-time motor control, RPM feedback, and modular ROS 2 nodes for future expansion.

## Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with ROS 2 (Humble)
- Simulate and test the robot using Gazebo
- Build and control a differential drive robot using teleoperation
- Understand the integration of embedded systems with ROS 2
- Maintain a clean, modular development process with thorough documentation

## Features

- ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu MATE 22.04
- Teleoperation control via ROS 2
- Serial communication between Raspberry Pi and microcontroller
- Real-time motor control with RPM feedback
- Expandable architecture for sensors, navigation, and autonomy

## Tech Stack

- ROS 2 Humble
- Ubuntu MATE 22.04
- Raspberry Pi 4
- PlatformIO & Arduino Framework
- ROS 2 nodes written in C++ and Python
